I had a fantastic time at Ta-ste, where my main task was patternmaking and  prototype development for CORTEX A/W 2013/2014 collection. I enjoyed it so much, I extended my internship to the end of the collection process. I was eager to see the end result, it was a great experience to learn how the production was made and how the photoshoot took place.
