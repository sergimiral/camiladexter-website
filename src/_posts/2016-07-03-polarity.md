After many months traveling around Asia, followed by an extended research that went from the culture and clothing tradition of the countries I had visited, to a more general research of how the industry of fashion is evolving and which direction it's taking. I had a concept in mind.

# CONCEPT

I was going to create my own tradition.
I’ve always been a person that explores many horizontals, a person that with one concepts ends up mixing it with the opposite, a person that likes everything and nothing at the same time.
Somehow amazed with the colourful fabrics from India, but still someone that considers navy o beige to be the most colourful item in her wardrobe. So why not use this as an advantage, it’s my weapon of combat.

The way I wanted this project to go is by mixing my own traditions with all the wonderful things a learned in my trip. This collection is all about POLARITY.

> I picked up small details from everywhere I went.

# INSPIRATION

When buying the fabrics I tried to buy two types of fabric: natural & artificial, bright & bold, soft & stiff…
Since the start I had a clear idea in my mind that I did not want this to be an other Asian collection, seen so many times. While designing I used small denotations from these countries, like the long skirts seen in Indian culture as women don’t show their legs, but to the contrary they do wear short tops, many of them backless. These two points where key while creating. Something else that caught my eye, was that men, from any social class, wore suit pants.

Another characteristic that caught my attention was the way Japanese used their fabrics. As they use silk that is very expensive, they don’t create they garments with pattern, but by folding and draping. They also use lots of pleats, big sleeves and raglan. Some of these features will be found in the collection.
But we mustn’t forget that my target is a European women. That want to feel special in her everyday clothes, they are looking for clean cuts, craftsmanship and exquisite fabrics.
With all of this in mind, it was time to create.

# BRIEFING

Target: Woman 20-40 years
Season 2015. Due to its clean cuts this collection can be reproduced every season with different fabrics and colours.
This collection offer a wide range of classic items that don’t go out of trend. They are limited edition as the fabrics are limited and brought from India.
It’s possible to make small adjustments every season, but the silhouettes are permanent.
There is a total of 25 looks, excluding the night collection, of which we only find some pieces.
The main collection consist in perfectly tailored trouser in fine wool, that give a very sophisticated appearance combined with more playful shirts, that can be made longer to content the target group. Followed by short skirts with longer ones underneath. To combine with these looks you will also find a series of jackets and coats.
