I had a concept in mind.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sergimiral.github.io/camiladexter-website/assets/images/img-polarity-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;ALT&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sergimiral.github.io/camiladexter-website/assets/images/img-polarity-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;ALT&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCEPT&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to create my own tradition.
I’ve always been a person that explores many horizontals, a person that with one concepts ends up mixing it with the opposite, a person that likes everything and nothing at the same time.
Somehow amazed with the colourful fabrics from India, but still someone that considers navy o beige to be the most colourful item in her wardrobe. So why not use this as an advantage, it’s my weapon of combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I wanted this project to go is by mixing my own traditions with all the wonderful things a learned in my trip. This collection is all about POLARITY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sergimiral.github.io/camiladexter-website/assets/images/img-polarity-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;ALT&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up small details from everywhere I went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;INSPIRATION&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When buying the fabrics I tried to buy two types of fabric: natural &amp;amp; artificial, bright &amp;amp; bold, soft &amp;amp; stiff…
Since the start I had a clear idea in my mind that I did not want this to be an other Asian collection, seen so many times. While designing I used small denotations from these countries, like the long skirts seen in Indian culture as women don’t show their legs, but to the contrary they do wear short tops, many of them backless. These two points where key while creating. Something else that caught my eye, was that men, from any social class, wore suit pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sergimiral.github.io/camiladexter-website/assets/images/img-polarity-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;ALT&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another characteristic that caught my attention was the way Japanese used their fabrics. As they use silk that is very expensive, they don’t create they garments with pattern, but by folding and draping. They also use lots of pleats, big sleeves and raglan. Some of these features will be found in the collection.
But we mustn’t forget that my target is a European women. That want to feel special in her everyday clothes, they are looking for clean cuts, craftsmanship and exquisite fabrics.
With all of this in mind, it was time to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sergimiral.github.io/camiladexter-website/assets/images/img-polarity-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;ALT&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;BRIEFING&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Target: Woman 20-40 years
Season 2015. Due to its clean cuts this collection can be reproduced every season with different fabrics and colours.
This collection offer a wide range of classic items that don’t go out of trend. They are limited edition as the fabrics are limited and brought from India.
It’s possible to make small adjustments every season, but the silhouettes are permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sergimiral.github.io/camiladexter-website/assets/images/img-polarity-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;ALT&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a total of 25 looks, excluding the night collection, of which we only find some pieces.
The main collection consist in perfectly tailored trouser in fine wool, that give a very sophisticated appearance combined with more playful shirts, that can be made longer to content the target group. Followed by short skirts with longer ones underneath. To combine with these looks you will also find a series of jackets and coats.&lt;/p&gt;

Playing with two contrasting fabrics, one strong symbolizing firmness and another one steamy for settling into this world.

Using the method of making a dye reservation to end up with a degraded piece of clothing, because this gives us the option of doing it with different colours and shades and each item will be unique.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sergi Miral</name><email>sergimiral@gmail.com</email><uri>sergimiral.com</uri></author><summary type="html">Ghost was the original concept for this collection but then the focus was drawn to their vanishing in a romantic scene with a dark misty night with full moon, where the most inexplicable events happen.

So this collection is geared towards a strong, decided and fearless woman, that overcomes all the obstacles that are planted along the road. Playing with two contrasting fabrics, one strong symbolizing firmness and another one steamy for settling into this world. I considered the night and the moon, which amalgamate the one with the other, creating a gradient path.





After the research was done I found that the best way to represent the feeling of vanishing or fading away was by dying the clothes myself. Using the method of making a dye reservation to end up with a degraded piece of clothing, because this gives us the option of doing it with different colours and shades and each item will be unique.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://sergimiral.github.iohttp://sergimiral.github.io/camiladexter-websitecover-fadeaway.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Capitals</title><link href="http://sergimiral.github.iohttp://sergimiral.github.io/camiladexter-website/project/2012/11/01/capitals/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Capitals" /><published>2012-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2012-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://sergimiral.github.iohttp://sergimiral.github.io/camiladexter-website/project/2012/11/01/capitals</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://sergimiral.github.iohttp://sergimiral.github.io/camiladexter-website/project/2012/11/01/capitals/">&lt;p&gt;This mini collection is inspired in six different world cities. We thought this was timely due to all the team being away from their city homes. The cities are: Shanhai, London, New York, Berlin, Paris and were it all began, Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each city, a concept and specific colour palette was chosen. Because each city has it’s own features and atmosphere, a business woman in Berlin will not be wearing the same clothes than a women in Paris, let alone in cities like Shanghai. An extensive trend research was done from current business clothing for women to fashion shows with the purpose of finding the right balance between the current trends and the everyday clothing that women currently had in their wardrobes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresh out of college it was a great experience to be able to travel to Shanghai and accompany and learn from MAKE YOUR SUIT. Getting to see first hand how things really work in a company and furthermore, in a massive production site. Learning how the garments are  transferred from CAD files to the finished product and all the machines and hands it goes truth.&lt;/p&gt;
