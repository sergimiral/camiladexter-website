Tailor & Tales is an emerging menswear service revolutionising the way we shop. Tailor & Tales places the power back in the hands of the consumer by removing the need to conform to standard sizes. Instead, Tailor & Tales takes measurements once to create the consumer's size and works with existing brands like Eton, Van Laack and Tombolini to produce one-off garments on demand for each of it's customers. Now, the customer has the power to select any garment, brand or style. With a single click it will be made to his size, every time.

My role as T&T designer consisted in creating a collection for each and every brand, maintaining the essence of the brand I was design for and keeping up with the current trends. For that I assisted trade fair like Pitti, Premium, Premier, Bread & Butter. In which I would watch out for trends and street style, pop in and say hi! to our brands and see what was new that season and buy fabrics for some of our brands (like the NYMB denim collection you will see below).
