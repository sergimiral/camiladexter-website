Ghost was the original concept for this collection but then the focus was drawn to their vanishing in a romantic scene with a dark misty night with full moon, where the most inexplicable events happen.
The pale faces of ghosts, nearly translucent, like some women's faces influenced by the society in which we live, that potent vanity, extreme thinness and causes the fainting of women transforming her in another ghost.

So this collection is geared towards a strong, decided and fearless woman, that overcomes all the obstacles that are planted along the road. Playing with two contrasting fabrics, one strong symbolizing firmness and another one steamy for settling into this world. I considered the night and the moon, which amalgamate the one with the other, creating a gradient path.

After the research was done I found that the best way to represent the feeling of vanishing or fading away was by dying the clothes myself. Using the method of making a dye reservation to end up with a degraded piece of clothing, because this gives us the option of doing it with different colours and shades and each item will be unique.
