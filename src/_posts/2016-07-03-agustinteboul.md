During my internship in Augustin Teboul I worked on the  Spring/Summer 14 “Holy me” collection. I did the patterns for the following items.

Also I got to be part of the fashion show, helping the models get dressed and assisting during the whole show.

When the new collection was presented I still had some weeks left before my internship was over where I hand stitched the accessories for the FALL/WINTER 13/14 "SOMEWHEN".

Yes, that's me hand-stitching :)
