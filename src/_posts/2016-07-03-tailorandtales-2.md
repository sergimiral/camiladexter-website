I was the Senior Tailor and Tales stylist. That meant treating with our customers, offering them a measuring appointment and styling advice. At the very start T&T offered pop up events in Stockholm, Zurich and Berlin. Where I prepared the materials with the branding team and measured and styled the customers, as training the new stylist that joined the team.

Working close with the product team, we developed an exquisite measuring system, developing our own test shirts, that already fit the customer better than any other shirt in a standard size.The size profile Tailor & Tales creates for each customers works with all of it's partner brands so no matter which product you choose, or which style shirt, suit or overcoat it will be an amazing fit every time.

# STYLING GUIDELINES

 As part of the training of new T&T stylist I created informative booklets with the following information:

- Shirt & Suit customizations.
- Gentleman dressing rules.
- Style advice for every body type, skin and eye colour.
- Explanation of all you need to know of men clothing from how it’s made to how to take care of it.
- Fabric explanation.

# Photoshoot stylist

This was one of the most interesting experience. Working with a photographer Robin Karter, make up artist Timo Bloom and creative director Sarah Hough was a guarantee of success. Here are some of the best shoots:
