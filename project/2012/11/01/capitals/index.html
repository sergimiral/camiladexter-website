    <p>MAKE YOUR SUIT</p>

<p>Conceptual fashion design.</p>

<p>Shanghai - November 2012 .</p>

<p>This mini collection is inspired in six different world cities. We thought this was timely due to all the team being away from their city homes. The cities are: Shanhai, London, New York, Berlin, Paris and were it all began, Barcelona.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/img-capitals-1.png" alt="ALT"></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/img-capitals-2.png" alt="ALT"></p>

<p>For each city, a concept and specific colour palette was chosen. Because each city has it’s own features and atmosphere, a business woman in Berlin will not be wearing the same clothes than a women in Paris, let alone in cities like Shanghai. An extensive trend research was done from current business clothing for women to fashion shows with the purpose of finding the right balance between the current trends and the everyday clothing that women currently had in their wardrobes.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/img-capitals-5.png" alt="ALT"></p>

<p>Fresh out of college it was a great experience to be able to travel to Shanghai and accompany and learn from MAKE YOUR SUIT. Getting to see first hand how things really work in a company and furthermore, in a massive production site. Learning how the garments are  transferred from CAD files to the finished product and all the machines and hands it goes truth.</p>
